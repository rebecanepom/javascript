        6e. Continuing from exercise 6d, let's say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;
         * Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.
         * Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets () to control which code gets done first.
         * Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages
